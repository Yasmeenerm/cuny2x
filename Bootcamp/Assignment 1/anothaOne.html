  <h3> At my older sister's Graduation,
      <br>a guest speaker spoke of the hard times
      <br>He said it was now more than ever that we
      <br>must continue to pursue change and
      <br>make a difference,
      <br>He addressed the Graduates that did not complete
      <br>degrees in political science, journalism and public relations.
      <br>He told these students to not be discouraged that
      <br>their majors dont align with specific roles,
      <br>To instead,
      <br> make a difference through the fields they've mastered in,
      <br>because the world will not progress if change is pushed
      <br>from only one direction we must push for change from all fields.</h3>
