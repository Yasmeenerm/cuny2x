     Now this a story all about how,
     <br>My life got flipped turned upside down
     <br>And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
     <br>I'll tell you how I became a student in a place somewhere
     <br>In Brooklyn New York, born and raised
     <br>On the Playstatiom is where I spent most of my days
     <br>Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
